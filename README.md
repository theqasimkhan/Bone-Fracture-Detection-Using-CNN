Bone Fracture Detection using X-ray Images

- Implemented CNN-based classifier for binary fracture detection
- Applied medical image preprocessing: Gaussian filtering + Canny edge segmentation
- Trained model on Kaggle dataset (`vuppalaadithyasairam/bone-fracture-detection-using-xrays`)
- Added functions for single/batch prediction
- Model saved as `fracture_cnn_model.h5` for future use
